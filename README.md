BEFORE THIS WEEK I HAD ZERO KNOWLEDGE OF MONGO-DB AND NODE-JS, AFTER THE ANNOUCEMENT OF THE CHALLENGE OF WEEK-2, I STARTED LEARNING NODE, EXPRESS AND MONGO-DB, FOR THE FIRST 5 DAYS I WAS JUST LEARNING, IN THE LAST TWO DAYS I BUILT THIS SIMPLE TODO-APP, BUT IT IS LAST DAY OF SUBMISSION AND I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEPLOY THIS FULL STACK APPLICATION, SO I AM SUBMITTING THIS AS IT IS, I ALSO UPLOADED THE NODE-MODULES BUT DO-NOT WORRY IT WILL BE PULLED EASILY ON YOUR LOCAL SYSTEM, HOWEVER I AM OKAY IF YOU WILL CUT MY POINTS FOR NOT DEPLOYING IT. I LEARNT ALOT THIS WEEK, THANKYOU DEV-DAYS, WAITING FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE.
